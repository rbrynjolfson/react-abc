### Engraver Params
| Param           | Default   | Description |
| ---             | ---       | ---         |
| `add_classes `  | false     | If true, then each element that is drawn on the SVG will have an identifying class with it that you can use to style, move, or hide the element. |
| `editable `     | false     | If true, then when a note is clicked, it is highlighted and a callback allows the editor to move the cursor. |
| `listener `     | null      | This is an object containing up to two functions. The format is: { highlight: function(abcElem) {}, modelChanged: function(abcElem) {} } The highlight function is called whenever the user clicks on a note or selects a series of notes. The modelChanged function is called whenever the user has changed the music visually. |
| `paddingbottom `| 30        | The spacing that the music should have on the web page. |
| `paddingleft `  | 15        | The spacing that the music should have on the web page. |
| `paddingright ` | 50        | The spacing that the music should have on the web page. |
| `paddingtop `   | 15        | The spacing that the music should have on the web page. |
| `responsive `   | undefined | |
| `scale `        | 1         | If the number passed is between zero and one, then the music is printed smaller, if above one, then it is printed bigger. |
| `staffwidth `   | 740       | The width of the music, in pixels. |

### Parser Params
| Param             | Default | Description |
| ---               | ---     | ---         |
| `header_only`     | false   | Only parse the header |
| `hint_measures`   | false   | Repeat the next measure at the end of the previous line, with a unique css class. |
| `print` .         | false   | Pay attention to margins and other formatting commands that don't make sense in a web page |
| `stop_on_warning` | false   | Only parse until the first warning is encountered |

### Render Params
| Param                | Default | Description |
| ---                  | ---     | ---         |
| `oneSvgPerLine`      | false   | Should each system of staves be rendered to a different SVG? This makes controlling with CSS easier, and makes it possible to paginate cleanly. |
| `scrollHorizontal`   | false   | Should there be a horizontal scrollbar if the music is wider than the viewport? (requires viewportHorizontal to be true.) |
| `startingTune`       | 0       | The index of the tune in the tunebook to render (starting at zero for the first tune). |
| `viewportHorizontal` | false   | Should the horizontal width be limited by the device's width? |

### Timing Params
| Param | Default | Description |
| ------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `qpm` | whatever is in the Q: field | Number of beats per minute. |
| `extraMeasuresAtBeginning` | 0 | Don't start the callbacks right away, but insert these number of measures first. |
| `beatCallback` | null | Called for each beat passing the beat number (starting at 0). |
| `eventCallback` | null | Called for each event (either a note, a rest, or a chord, and notes in separate voices are grouped together.) |
| `lineEndCallback` | null | Called at the end of each line. (This is useful if you want to be sure the music is scrolled into view at the right time.) See `lineEndAnticipation` for more details. |
| `lineEndAnticipation` | 0 | The number of milliseconds for the `lineEndCallback` to anticipate end of the line. That is, if you want to get the callback half a second before the end of the line, use 500. |
| `beatSubdivisions` | 1 | How many callbacks should happen for each beat. This allows finer control in the client, for instance, to handle a progress bar. |

### TimingCallbacks

Generates instance of abcjs TimingCallbacks controls through a callback handler to return an object with the properties `start()`, `stop()`, `pause()`, `reset()`, `setProgress(percent)`.  

These timing controls are useful if you want to interact with the notation using an audio track instead of MIDI 

__Usage:__ 
`onSetControls((controls) => setControls(controls))` 

  *** Also requires timingParams to be set for Notation component

Where setControls is a React hooks useState instance, or class function to store the returned state from the handler.
